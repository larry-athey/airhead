# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why am I getting such low-proof distillate?

A: You're running your temperature entirely too hot. Start with a target temperature of 80C/176F and feel the air blowing out the top of the still when ethanol starts flowing. You'll notice that the air really isn't very hot.
