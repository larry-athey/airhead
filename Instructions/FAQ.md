# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why am I getting such low-proof distillate?

A: You're running your temperature entirely too hot. Start with a target temperature of 80C/176F and feel the air blowing out the top of the still when ethanol starts flowing. You'll notice that the air really isn't very hot. Then try a target temperature of 88C/190F and feel the air, it will feel much warmer. This is because you're getting water vapor into the condenser which carries much more heat and you will water down your distillate. Avoid going over 86C/186F and you can get 140 proof distillate just fine.
