# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why am I getting such low-proof distillate?

A: You're running your temperature entirely too hot. Start with a target temperature of 80C/176F and feel the air blowing out the top of the still when ethanol starts flowing. You'll notice that the air is mostly cool. Then try a target temperature of 88C/190F and feel the air, it will feel much warmer. This is because you're getting water vapor into the condenser which carries much more heat and you will water down your distillate. Avoid going over 86C/186F unless you intentionally want to water it down.

Q: What is the benefit to using a progressive temperature in mode 3?

A: If you were to run at a set target temperature of 80C/176F, it could take you 6 hours or more to get all of the ethanol out. Your output slows down as the ethanol is removed and you may only see one drop per minute after a couple hours, even though there's still a decent amount of ethanol remaining inside. Starting at 80C/176F and ending at 86C/186F over 2 hours will achieve the same result in far less time.

Q: What are the popping noises that I keep hearing coming out of the still?

A: That's vapor condensing back into a liquid and blocking the air path, it's just bubbles popping. Nothing to be alarmed about, nothing is broken. It's just because the condenser used here is mostly horizontal rather than vertical like larger stills.

Q: What is the highest proof that you can get out of one of these stills?

A: The highest I've ever gotten was 140 and that was from a Gin redistillation run at a constant 80C/176F over 8 hours. The object was to tame down the flavor from the juniper berries but I just ended up with really high proof Gin. Distilling normal stuff like wine to make Brandy, usually ends up being between 110 and 120 on a 2 hour progressive run.

Q: Can you use one of these to tame down something that was aged on too much char?

A: Absolutely! Just be sure to do a vingar run afterwards because it will leave char on the inside of the condenser. Knock your existing hooch down to 80 proof first and then redistill it at 80C/176F to 86C/186F so water vapor doesn't carry the char flavor through. Knock the secondary distillation down to anywhere from 110 to 120 proof and age it again with less char.
