# Airhead Operation

As you have probably noticed by the photos on the frant page of this GitHub repo, the Airhead has three operating modes. Each of the modes are user configurable and your last used settings will be restored each time you start up your still.

**Mode 1** maintains a constant power level with no power management whatsoever. You may adjust the power level from 10% to 100%. Both SCRs and SSRs behave unpredictably below 10% power, so this lower limit is intentionally imposed. This mode would be used for simmering liquids or distilling water if you set the power level to 100%. There is a safety feature that will shut down your still if you boil out all of the water. This kicks in at 103C/217F well before the internal circuit breaker trips.
