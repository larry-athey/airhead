# Airhead Operation

As you have probably noticed by the photos on the frant page of this GitHub repo, the Airhead has three operating modes. Each of the modes are user configurable and your last used settings will be restored each time you start up your still.

**Mode 1** maintains a constant power level with no power management whatsoever. You may adjust the power level from 10% to 100%. Both SCRs and SSRs behave unpredictably below 10% power, so this lower limit is intentionally imposed.
