# Instructions

In these examples, I'm using a cheap $65 [Vevor water distiller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN2SBJLT). No need for an expensive original Air Still for this project. I will also be setting up this one to use a solid state relay rather than an SCR controller.

Referring to the photo **Air-Still-Default-Wiring.jpg** here. The white wires are connected to the thermal control snap switch and are the AC neutral connection to the heating element. The blue wires are for an LED power indicator on the front of the still. The red wires are from the AC hot side and go to a circuit breaker on the front of the still and then come back to connect to the other side of the heating element. Lastly, the yellow wires are the earth ground of the AC connection and connect to the body of the boiler vessel. You will need to remove that aluminum bracket to get to the screws on the thermal control snap switch in order to remove it.
