# Instructions

In these examples, I'm using a cheap $65 [Vevor water distiller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN2SBJLT) Since its thermal control is a 100C/212F snap switch. If you are using a unit that is only for ethanol distillation, you're going to need to bypass your snap switch. Simply remove the wires from it and insert them together. You will need to remove the heat shrink tubing in order to do this. Once you have them connected, simply wrap the connection with electrical tape. If you have heat shrink tubing and blade connector couplers, that's even better yet.

Refer to the photo **Air-Still-Default-Wiring.jpg** in the above.
