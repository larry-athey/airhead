# Instructions

In these examples, I'm using a cheap $65 [Vevor water distiller](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN2SBJLT) since its thermal control is a 100C/212F snap switch. If you are using a unit that is only for ethanol distillation, you're going to need to bypass your 80C/176F snap switch. Simply remove the wires from it and insert them together. You will need to remove the heat shrink tubing in order to do this. Once you have them connected, simply wrap the connection with electrical tape. If you have heat shrink tubing and blade connector couplers, that's even better yet.

Refer to the photo **Air-Still-Default-Wiring.jpg** in the above. The white wires are connected to the thermal control snap switch and are the AC neutral connection to the heating element. The blue wires are for an LED power indicator on the front of the still. The red wires are from the AC hot side and go to a circuit breaker on the front of the still and come back to connect to the other side of the heating element. Lastly, the yellow wires are the earth ground of the AC connection and connect to the body of the boiler vessel.
