Printed circuit board for the Airhead PSU and Interface, designed by [James "The Doc"](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDocChannel) from Ireland. This PCB supports PWM or voltage controlled SCR boards, and can be used with a solid state relay by simply soldering wires to the board to connect to the control side of your SSR. These wires would be connected to any ground hole and the center pin for the PWM/+5V jumper.
